# Simple Harmonic Motion Experiment

With the built-in accelerometer, you will be able to demonstrate and analyze simple harmonic motion.
Accelerometers can be used to measure a device acceleration. The sensor measures acceleration along 3 orthogonal axes: X, Y and Z. 
Acceleration readings include the acceleration of gravity. For example: If the device is at rest, lying flat on a table on the surface 
of the earth, the acceleration along the z axis should equal the acceleration of gravity (~9.8 m/s^2), and the acceleration along the
x and y axes should be 0.

### Aim: plot a graph of acceleration against time

### Materials
*	Plastic bag
* Spring
*	Retort stand

### Procedure 
The spring should be attached to the retort stand. The raspberry pi is placed in a plastic bag. Attach the plastic bag containing the
raspberry pi to the spring.  By pulling the spring, you will be able to use the accelerometer on the sense hat to record the changes in 
acceleration as the spring bounces up and down. For this experiment, we are only interested in the acceleration in the x and y axes.
