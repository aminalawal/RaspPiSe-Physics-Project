# RaspPiSe-Physics-Project

The Raspberry Pi Sense HAT project (RaspPiSe) aims to engage and motivate students learning programming in Python at the University of Cape Town. The target students are Computer Science students in the CSC1010H course, and Physics students in the PHY1023H course. The Physics students will be performing experiments and implementing code on the Raspberry Pi and SenseHAT for recording data from the sensors and then completing questions based on the experiments.The Computer Science students will be engaged by replacing some of their traditional assignments with games that they would implement on the Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT. We hope that the students will enjoy these practicals more than the traditional ones, and thus engage the content more, leading to improved programming skill.

This repository contains the experiment tasks and questions for use in the PHY1203H course.

### PHY1023H Experiments and Data Analysis with the Raspberry Pi and SenseHat
We used the Raspberry Pi and SenseHat to carryout few physics experiments to enable studennts learn programming and physics concepts as well.The experiments designed are simple harmonic motion and Gay lussac's law experiments

#### Gay Lussac’s Law Experiment
With the built-in temperature and pressure sensors, you will be able to demonstrate Gay-Lussac’s law. Gay-Lussac’s shows the relationship between the pressure and temperature of a fixed mass of gas kept at a constant volume.

#### Simple harmonic motion Experiment
Simple harmonic motion occurs when the force on an object is proportional and in the opposite direction to the displacement of the object. Examples include masses on springs and pendula, which 'bounce' back and forth repeatedly.
