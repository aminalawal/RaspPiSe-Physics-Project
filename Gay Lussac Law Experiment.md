## Gay Lussac's Law Experiment

The law states that the pressure of a gas of fixed mass and fixed volume is directly proportional to the gas's absolute temperature. 
If a gas's temperature increases, then so does its pressure provided that the mass and volume of the gas are held constant.
This law holds true because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a substance; as the kinetic energy of a gas increases,
its particles collide with the container walls more rapidly, thereby exerting increased pressure.

### Aim: To plot a graph of pressure against temperature

### Materials
* Glass jar
*	Freezing or heating mechanism (hot water, ice, refrigerator, microwave)
*	Buckets

### Procedure
The Raspberry Pi is placed in the empty glass jar that seals the air within thus, creating a constant volume system. Therefore,
heating or cooling the air inside the jar will change the temperature and pressure exerted.These changes will then be recorded onto
your Raspberry Pi.  After changing the temperature, allow a few minutes for the air in the jar to reach the temperature of the freezing
or heating mechanism to keep the temperature uniform. Once the system has appeared to reach equilibrium, record temperature and pressure.
Repeat the procedure for different freezing and heating mechanisms.
